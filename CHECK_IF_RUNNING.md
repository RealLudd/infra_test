# üîç How to Check if Task is Running

## Quick Check: Look at the Log File

Open the file: **`bpa_log.txt`** in your project folder

You'll see entries like:
```
[2025-10-28 09:20:33] POPUP SHOWN
[2025-10-28 09:21:15] SILENT RUN
[2025-10-28 09:21:35] SILENT RUN
[2025-10-28 09:21:55] SILENT RUN
```

### What It Means:

**`POPUP SHOWN`** = Task ran and showed the chicken popup  
**`SILENT RUN`** = Task ran silently (SHOW_MESSAGE = False)

---

## ‚úÖ If Task is Working:

You'll see new entries **every 20 seconds** (or your interval):
```
[2025-10-28 09:21:15] SILENT RUN
[2025-10-28 09:21:35] SILENT RUN  ‚Üê 20 seconds later
[2025-10-28 09:21:55] SILENT RUN  ‚Üê 20 seconds later
[2025-10-28 09:22:15] SILENT RUN  ‚Üê 20 seconds later
```

This proves it's running perfectly! ‚úÖ

## ‚ùå If Task is NOT Working:

**No new entries** = Task scheduler isn't running the task

**Possible reasons:**
1. Task is disabled in Task Scheduler
2. Task failed to start (check Task Scheduler History)
3. VBS file path is wrong
4. "Start in" directory is wrong

## üß™ Quick Test:

### 1. Set SHOW_MESSAGE to False (silent mode)
From Claude mobile:
```
Change SHOW_MESSAGE to False in daily_task.py
```

### 2. Wait and Watch the Log
Open `bpa_log.txt` and refresh it every 20 seconds

You should see:
```
[time1] SILENT RUN
[time2] SILENT RUN  ‚Üê 20 seconds later
[time3] SILENT RUN  ‚Üê 20 seconds later
```

### 3. Activate Popup
From Claude mobile:
```
Change SHOW_MESSAGE to True in daily_task.py
```

### 4. Watch for Popup
Within 20 seconds:
- Log shows: `[time] POPUP SHOWN`
- Popup appears with chicken! üêî

## üìä Log File Location:

```
C:\Users\SA_DE_RPA\infra_test\bpa_log.txt
```

**Tip:** Keep this file open in Notepad and refresh it (Ctrl+R or close/reopen) to see updates!

## üîß Troubleshooting:

### Log shows entries but no popup appears
- Check: Is SHOW_MESSAGE = True?
- Run manually: `wscript run_invisible.vbs`
- Check Task Scheduler: Is task set to "Run whether user is logged on or not"?

### Log file is empty or doesn't exist
- Task isn't running at all
- Check Task Scheduler: Is task enabled?
- Test manually: Double-click `run_invisible.vbs`

### Log stops updating
- Task crashed or was disabled
- Check Task Scheduler History tab for errors
- Restart the task manually

## ‚ú® Perfect Setup:

When working correctly, you'll see:

**Silent Mode (SHOW_MESSAGE = False):**
```
[09:20:15] SILENT RUN
[09:20:35] SILENT RUN
[09:20:55] SILENT RUN
[09:21:15] SILENT RUN
```
No popups, just logs every 20 seconds ‚úÖ

**Active Mode (SHOW_MESSAGE = True):**
```
[09:21:35] POPUP SHOWN  ‚Üê Chicken appears!
[09:21:55] POPUP SHOWN  ‚Üê Chicken appears again!
[09:22:15] POPUP SHOWN  ‚Üê Still showing!
```
Popup appears every 20 seconds with chicken üêî
