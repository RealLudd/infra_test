# 📱 Claude Mobile - Quick Command Reference

## 🎯 How to Edit Code from Mobile Without Manual Merging

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Ask Claude to Commit to Main (Recommended)

Change the message in daily_task.py from 
"Hello Marco" to "Testing mobile edit!"
```

**Key phrases:**

```

**No need to specify the branch!** 

The batch file will:
1. Pull latest code
2. **Automatically find Claude branches**
3. **Merge them automatically**
4. Run the script with new code!

### 1. Be Specific
**Good:** "Change line 15 in daily_task.py from 'Hello Marco' to 'Hello World'"
**Bad:** "Update the message"

### 2. Mention the File
**Good:** "In daily_task.py, change..."
**Better:** "Commit to main branch. In daily_task.py, change..."

### 3. Test Changes
After Claude commits:
- Wait for next scheduled run
- Or test immediately: Double-click `run_task.bat`

### 4. Multiple Changes
You can ask for multiple changes at once:
```
In daily_task.py:
1. Change the greeting
2. Update the date
3. Add a new status message
4. Change sleep time to 5 seconds
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "I made changes but don't see them"

**Check:**
1. Did Claude finish committing? (Check Claude chat)
2. Is the batch file running? (Look for window)
3. Try running manually: `cmd /c run_task.bat`

### "Claude created a branch instead of using main"

**No problem!** The batch file auto-merges Claude branches now.

Just run `run_task.bat` and it will:
- Find the Claude branch
- Merge automatically
- Use the new code ✅

### "Want to see changes immediately"

After editing on mobile:
1. Double-click `run_task.bat`
2. Or run in terminal: `cmd /c run_task.bat`
3. Changes apply immediately!
